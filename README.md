## ITSC Personalised Responses
---

### React JS using FireBase Auth and FireStore DB

This app is to create a golden source of truth for the text responses to enquiries at the UTS IT Support center. 

Anyone can access and anyone that authenticates with a @uts.edu.au can create new, edit and delete. 

This is my first play with google FireBase.

Created in 4 night while on holidays over the Christmas brake 2021.
